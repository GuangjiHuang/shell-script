    ```shell
    # I want to check if there is using the ssh, if use the ssh connection, there weill be the environment variable: SSH_CONNECTION.
    # so I write the code as follow:
    if [[ -n $SSH_CONNECTION ]];then
    	echo "do something"
    fi
    # that will make the error, because SSH_CONNECTION is the: 202.38.214.68 1234 202.38.214.111 22
    # image that use the above string to substitude the SSH_CONNECTION, that will make the error. So remember to add the quote!
    if [[ -n "$SSH_CONNNECTION" ]];then
    	echo "do something"
    fi
    ```
